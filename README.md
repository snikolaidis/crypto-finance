# Crypto Finance

## What's this all about?

Ok, we're all, more or less, following the trend and hype of cryptocurrencies. This project is about small command line tools that will help you give a better idea on what we're talking about.

## Let's clarify a couple of things

I am fully aware that a lot of python experts will start laughing with my code. Keep in mind that although 20 years as a software engineer, I just started learning python. And this was the way I found to learn it. So please, bear with me. :-)

### Data: coins

The most important list, the list of coins. You can see by yourself what we are talking about and what data we're keeping. :-)

### Project: Predictions and Investments

So, this project says the following:

What if I invest a specific amount every month for the following years on a specific coin (or coins)? What will be my total investment and the total outcome?
